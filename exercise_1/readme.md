### Basic Calculator
I want to create an html/js based calculator! I've provided the barebones
skeleton needed to get started on this, inlcuding an event handler for button
presses

#### What you need to do
1. Clone the git repository, make a new branch for your work
2. Familiarize yourself with the code and how it works. Open the console in your
   web browser and look at what information you can get from the events
3. Implement the calculator

#### Hints
 * Typing of variables will be a big part of this. Look into the parseInt() and
   parseFloat() functions
